# Hosts
Host lists to be used with DNS services that support regex (PiHole) and browser blocker (uBlock Origin). There are different files for each application, select accordingly.

## Services
These lists target entire services, they are intended for use only if you don't use the service. Usage of these block-lists **will** break the corresponding service(s). For regular blocking, use your providers default lists.
