Host lists for common services in adblock and regex syntax. Useful with ([AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome)) and ([uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/)). View the service-specific pages for references and list mirrors.

This project has **no affiliation** with any of the services mentioned. For information regarding specified services, please refer to the respective service website.

Some hosts may no longer be owned or utilized by a service, and some may be incorrect due to human error.

Replace `.txt` with `.sum` on each link for a SHA-256 checksum of the file.
