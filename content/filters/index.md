## YouTube Basic
Blocks YouTube Shorts, Ask, banners, comments, chat, posts, and shop.

Adds allow rules for the core YouTube domains. This list can be used with the [Stream](/stream/) or [Stream - YouTube](/stream/youtube/) lists; when used alongside either of those lists all non-essential YouTube domains will remain blocked.
